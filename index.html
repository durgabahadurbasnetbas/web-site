            Stargazers will be treated to a rare alignment of seven planets on 28 February when Mercury joins six other planets that are already visible in the night sky. Here's why it matters to scientists.

        <p>
            Peer up at the sky on a clear night this January and February and you could be in for a treat. Six planets  Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune  are currently visible in the night sky. During just one night in late February, they will be joined by Mercury, a rare seven-planet alignment visible in the sky.

            But such events are not just a spectacle for stargazers  they can also have a real impact on our Solar System and offer the potential to gain new insights into our place within it.

            While fascinating to observe, do such alignments have any impact here on Earth? Or might they have a use for increasing our understanding of our Solar System and beyond?

            In fact, says Millard, "it's just happenstance that they happen to be in this position of their orbits". And while there have been suggestions from some scientists that planetary alignments might cause impacts on Earth, the scientific basis for most of these claims is <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhyEd..52e3003C/">weak or non-existent</a>.

            In 2019, however, researchers suggested that planetary alignments <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-019-1447-1">could have an impact</a> on solar activity. One of the main outstanding questions about the Sun is what drives its 11-year cycle between periods of peak activity, known as solar maximum, and periods of weakest activity, solar minimum.
